PREFACE
=======
The script and templates haven't had a straightforward history it seems.
When I found Scott McCarty's Google code hosted project in 2012, it seemed things
were simple enough.
As of writing, Scott's fork is actively maintained, but not the most comprehensive fork.
Perhaps things will be updated in the future to try and merge all the forks,
but who knows.

Through a bit of reading on the cacti forums and some searching online, I realised
there was at least three forks of the original code and templates.

Did I miss something? Let me know?

Here is an attempt to document the history, for anyone who might be interested.

instead of one request per graph.

dainiookas by way of the cacti forums, contributes the very nice query cache hits code
and additional template. Perhaps these tweaks were borrowed from the Philo Vivero 
teMySQLcacti fork?

Kyle Milnes ships dainiookas changes and some tweaks to Scott McCarty for inclusion in
his Google code project Graph MySQL Stats.
* Supports MySQL hostname:port.
* A few coding best practices.
* Improved defaults in the templates.
* Use of the XML CDATA tag to avoid import issues and a bug in libxml2 which can mess
  up the template import.
