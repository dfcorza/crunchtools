UPGRADE
=======
Put the new mysql_stats.php file inside the cacti/scripts/ directory
If you wish, you can now archive or delete any other mysql_* php files...

Normally importing the XML files using the cacti-interface is enough to upgrade.
Cacti -> Console -> Import/Export -> Import Templates

Check to see if you need to add graphs for new additional templates.
