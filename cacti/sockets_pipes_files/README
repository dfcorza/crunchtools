Background
===============================================================================

Since everything in Linux/Unix is a file, Linux has some interesting ways to 
monitor for problems. Often systems administrators monitor CPU, Ram, Disk 
Space, and Network Usage. These are all valid data points and are especially 
useful for capacity planning. For real time detection of problems, especially 
with web/application/databases, these are not always the best indicators. In my 
experience, checking and trending the number of open sockets, pipes, files, 
tcp/udp sockets, and unix sockets has been the single best indicator of a 
problem. These have been much better than CPU, Load, or I/O Wait. In fact, 
under optimal usage of server hardware, one would expect spikes in CPU, RAM, 
and I/O.

Installation
===============================================================================

There are two components to the configuration
1. Cacti Server: The cacti server has a poller script. Also, there is a Nagios
   check which uses the same OID.
2. Polled Node: The polled node has an embedded perl module which extends
   net-snmp to support the OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.54

Cacti Server: Import XML template on the cacti server
    spf_cacti.xml

Cacti Server: Copy the poller script
    /var/www/html/cacti/scripts/spf_poller.sh

Polled Node: Copy the embeded AgentX Perl module to the client
    /etc/snmp/spf.pl

Polled Node: Configure snmp
    perl do '/etc/snmp/spf.pl';
