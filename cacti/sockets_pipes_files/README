Background
===============================================================================

Since everything in Linux/Unix is a file, Linux has some interesting ways to 
monitor for problems. Often systems administrators monitor CPU, Ram, Disk 
Space, and Network Usage. These are all valid data points and are especially 
useful for capacity planning. For real time detection of problems, especially 
with web/application/databases, these are not always the best indicators. In my 
experience, checking and trending the number of open sockets, pipes, files, 
tcp/udp sockets, and unix sockets has been the single best indicator of a 
problem. These have been much better than CPU, Load, or I/O Wait. In fact, 
under optimal usage of server hardware, one would expect spikes in CPU, RAM, 
and I/O.

Installation
===============================================================================

There is both a server component and a node component

Cacti Server
Import XML template on the cacti server
sockets_pipes_files_template.xml

Copy the poller script out to the cacti server
/usr/web/cacti/scripts/sockets_pipes_files_poller.sh

Remote Node
Copy the client script to the client
    /usr/local/bin/sockets_pipes_files_client.sh

Configure snmp on the client to have the following line
    sh .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.54 sockets_pipes_files /usr/local/bin/sockets_pipes_files_client.sh
