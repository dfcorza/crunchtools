Background
#################################################################################
In order to monitor BGP on a cisco router, you must first know what the normal
number of prefixes in memory is and also the number of messages sent/received.
Number of prefixes in memory is divided by 1000 to allow better vieweing of 
Prefixes overlaid with Messages RX/TX.

This data query has been tested on cacti 0.8.7e and Cisco 2851 routers.
